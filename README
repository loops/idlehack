Idlehack for Sway
-----------------

Listen for Firefox/Chromium dbus messages that request screensaver inhibit,
typically because the user is watching video.  Sway doesn't currently listen
for such messages, so here we create a daemon that listens for these messages
and then invokes "/bin/swayidle-inhibit" which is responsible for temporarily
disabling the screen blanking.

The XScreenSaver code which handled this was scavenged off of the net and
hacked, most of the credit should go to them.

Idlehack needs to be running in the background in order to create the dbus
listener before Firefox is launched.  Firefox only checks for the Dbus
end-points when first starting.  If it sees the dbus listener, it will
send the inhibit messages every time video is playing.

Idlehack will call /bin/swayidle-inhibit everytime such a message is
received from Firefox.

You need a "/bin/swayidle-inhibit"  that will do whatever is necessary
to inhibit the screensaver on your system for say 60 seconds.  Idlehack
will keep calling this command while the video is playing.   It's done
this way so that your screensaver isn't permanently inhibited if Firefox
crashes while holding the lock.


For a Systemd based system
--------------------------

Compile "idlehack" and move the executable to "/usr/libexec/"

Copy the "idlehack.service" file to "/etc/systemd/user/"

Copy "swayidle-inhibit" to "/bin/"

Run:
   # systemctl --user enable idlehack
   # systemctl --user start idlehack

Then restart Firefox


You can do "systemctl --user status idlehack" after starting a video to see that
the inhibit has been called.
